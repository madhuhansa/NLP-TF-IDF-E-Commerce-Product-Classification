# üß† E-Commerce Product Classification using TF-IDF + Machine Learning

This project performs **multi-class text classification** on an **e-commerce dataset** to classify product categories using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **Machine Learning**. The classification is done using models like **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. Text is preprocessed and vectorized using TF-IDF for improved performance and accuracy.

## üîß Technologies Used

- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- spaCy  
- joblib  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- TfidfVectorizer (from scikit-learn)  
- MultinomialNB, LogisticRegression, SVC (from scikit-learn)

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset contains **product names** from four categories:

- **Books**  
- **Clothing_Accessories**  
- **Electronics**  
- **Household**  

üìå The raw data was preprocessed in a separate notebook: `ecommerceDataset.ipynb`

### ‚ú® Preprocessing Steps with spaCy:
- Lemmatization  
- Stopword removal  
- Punctuation removal  
- Lowercasing  

Resulting in a clean dataset: `processed_ecommerceDataset.csv`, ready for model training.

## ‚úÖ Results & Observations

| Model                  | Accuracy  | Best F1-Score Category |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Multinomial Naive Bayes | 92%     | Household               |
| Logistic Regression     | 95%     | Clothing_Accessories    |
| **Linear SVM** (Best)   | **96%** | **Clothing_Accessories**|

üìå The **SVM** model performed the best and was saved as `best_model_svm.pkl`.
